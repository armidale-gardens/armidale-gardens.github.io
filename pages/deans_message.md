It is a great pleasure to write a welcome to everyone involved in the St Peter’s Garden tours again this year.

It has, at the time of writing, been a tough year for gardens and indeed for our wider rural society. Such difficulties are an ever present reminder that we are actually dependant beings. Against the rhetoric of our modern philosophies and the media that promotes them, the truth is that we aren’t “all powerful” or “in control of our own destinies”. Even as we join together in human desire and human action we will still find ourselves coming up short when it comes to the answers for the big questions of life. Where can I turn? Where is my hope?

The Bible takes a very different view of our situation to what we so often hear. It acknowledges human need in so many areas, and it recognises that a different world view can give different directions to take. In Matthew chapter 6 Jesus draws attention to the natural world and calls for us to take a different perspective. He says “see how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labour or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendour was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?” Jesus acknowledges the value of people, and the beauty of the natural world, and yet he asks us to recognise that over both stands the one who made us, provides for us, and the one to whom we are ultimately responsible. It is a different way of thinking and will result in a different way of behaving. It encourages trust, which at its heart is a deeply relational response.

It has been an up and down year for gardens, but that doesn’t mean that our year needs to be fruitless. It may be that this year, being reminded of our dependence, we will turn back to the one who holds all things in his hands and enjoy eternal fruit, for God is more interested in us than he is in those things that are here only for a season.
