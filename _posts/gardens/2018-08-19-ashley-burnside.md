My garden was last opened in 2011 when it was very new and very much a work in progress. This is still the case!!

About seix years ago I added a dry river bed as a successful feature. Then three years ago a bridge was added compliments of my brother-in-law.

I now propagate most of my plants from cuttings and repeat planting those that grow.

As the top of the rise was scraped away to build the house there is absolutely no soil and underneath is very heavy clay. So soil has been carted in and lots of mulch added. The trees that you see in the gullies and along the fence lines have all been planted over the last ten years to provide shelter for stock and to prevent erosion in the gully.

As there are no paths as such please just wander through the garden at your leisure.
