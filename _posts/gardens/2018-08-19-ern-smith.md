Ern and Diane Smith
 
Our garden is essentially that of a plant collector.  Many of our plants are derived from imported seed and not well known to Australian gardeners.  Therefore, a visit to our garden may be a journey of discovery.

The intention is to create a mosaic with plants, the picture ever changing as the viewer moves around the garden.

Great attention to plant placement regarding colour, height and texture is employed.

The garden is populated with cold climate (Alpine) plants, many of which may be admired only if the viewer looks INTO, rather than merely AT, it.

The great gardener, Gertrude Jekyll, proclaimed, “The purpose of a garden is to give happiness and repose of mind firstly and above all other considerations”.

We hope this is your experience when you visit.
