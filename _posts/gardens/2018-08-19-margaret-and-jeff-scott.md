After selling one of our properties at Kingstown in 2015 (due to Jeffâ€™s ongoing health issues) we decided to buy our retirement house in Uralla.

We were extremely lucky to find a house at Sandon Close as it is in such a quiet area of Uralla.

Our new home had magnificent established gardens which cover a very large area and were originally planned by a local nursery.

The previous owners, (The Pattons) had spent many long hours and a lot of expense in developing the garden.

As a result we have only had to make a few small changes to the gardens. A main feature of the gardens is the 80 beautiful rose bushes. The care of the roses takes most of our time.

The rest of the garden consists of mainly easy care trees (natives, fruit & palms etc.), shrubs and hedges. 

To date most of our work has been to maintain the garden, plant a few more shrubs and replace a few roses.

We do have some exciting plans for the future which include bordering more of the gardens, concreting the driveway edges and installing some water features. 

In spring the gardens are very beautiful and well worth inspecting particularly the roses.
